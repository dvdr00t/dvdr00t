### Hello there 👋

My name is Davide Arcolini 🤓. Happy to see you on my GitHub page! Hope you'll find here what you need and what you are looking for. Take a look around and *may the force be with you*.

#### Who I am and what I am doing
- Since I was a kid, I used to play with my dad's computer and mess things up because I had no idea of what I was doing. Today, I still don't have any clue of what I am doing. However, in 2021 I got a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering from **Politecnico di Torino** in Italy, with a 101/110 graduation mark.

- Now, I am enrolled in the Computer Engineering Master's Courses, majoring in **CyberSecurity**, still at **Politecnico di Torino**.\
Moreover, I am participating in the 2022 edition of **CyberChallenge.IT**, the italian training program for ethical hackers! 🧑‍💻 Here, besides playing CTF, I am learning how to break stuff by understanding how things works, such as: cryptography, web appications, reverse engineering, etc...

- On my profile you can find most of the courses I had attended during my studies. The repositories for these courses are named `PoliTo_<course_tag>`, such as: 
  - `PoliTo_OS` refers to the Operating System course;
  - `PoliTo_SDP` refers to the System and Device Programming course;
  - `PoliTo_CA` refers to the Computer Architectures course;
  - and so on.

  You can find what the tag refers to in the `README.md` file of every directory. Take a look at that also to know in which year I attended that particular course.

- Moreover, there is a special folder, called `PNRGs`, which contains my essay (and code implementation) on **Pseudo-Random Number Generator based on Logistic Chaotic Map and Generalized Lorenz Systems**. 

- Finally, there is the `CTFs Write-Up` folder, which contains a series of *write-ups* for some of the CTFs I attended (still working on it, my journey has just begun 😄). All the *write-ups* are very well commented assuming the reader knows nothing about the topics (since, more or less, that was my case).

> **As we are all learning (myself in the first place), feel free to suggest improvements of what you see!**

In the meanwhile, enjoy! 🧙🏼‍♂️
