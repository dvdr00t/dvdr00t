## üßë‚Äçüíª About me
Hi! My name is **Davide Arcolini**, but you can call me `dvdr00t` ü§ì!

As a Consultant at [**Liquid Reply**](https://www.reply.com/liquid-reply/en/) specializing in **LLM integration for application modernization**, I hold a Master of Science in **Computer Engineering** with a focus on cybersecurity from [**Politecnico di Torino**](https://www.polito.it/), Italy, earned in 2023, and a Bachelor's degree from the same institution obtained in 2021. During my academic journey, I delved into cybersecurity, engaging in projects such as developing a PRNG based on chaotic maps and participating in [**CyberChallenge.IT program**](https://bestr.it/award/show/rLlb917mQk-v6w0rGCpO8Q), ranking among the top 20 students. Additionally, I led teams in projects like [**Challenge@PoliTo**](https://bestr.it/award/show/8MiJNQU_R9uGIwqmioc4Uw) with [**Aruba S.p.A**](https://www.aruba.it/academy.aspx) and participated in various cyber-related conferences and competitions, including [**BIP CyberSec Talent Week**](https://www.vgen.it/it/bip-cybersec-talent-week/) and [**IEEE Eurocon 2023 B.Sc. and M.Sc. Student Competition**](https://2023.ieee-eurocon.org/). My master's thesis, "Full-Lifecycle API Management: Microgateway Infrastructural Pattern adopting Kong Gateway," was completed during my internship at Liquid Reply, where I focused on IAM solutions and automated API development on Kubernetes. I've also been active in [**IEEE-HKN's Mu Nu Chapter**](https://hknpolito.org/), serving as a Tutor and later as Head of Logistics and Fundraising, organizing events and dedicating over 230 hours as a teaching assistant at Politecnico, where I found fulfillment in simplifying complex concepts for others.

## üìö About my GitHub Page
- You can discover the majority of the solutions and reports from the courses I participated in during my academic journey on my profile. The collection of materials for these courses is referred to as `Polilabs`. If you're a Politecnico student seeking exercise solutions, feel free to explore the repository.

- You can also find the `CTFs` folder, which contains a series of *write-ups* for some of the CTFs I attended (still working on it, my journey has just begun üòÑ). The original intention was to create a repository which contains write-ups in the form of small blog posts that covers more or less the whole topic of the challenge. However, this requires more time than expected, so feel free to help!

- Finally, there are some *special* folders: 
  - `PNRGs` contains my essay (and code implementation) on **Pseudo-Random Number Generator based on Logistic Chaotic Map and Generalized Lorenz Systems**. It a super cool project I did at the end of the Bachelor of Science program, working on chaotic systems to generate pseudo random numbers. Check it out!
  - `OS161-SHELL` contains the *os161* kernel implementation (ASST0 to ASST3) that allows the system to run concurrent multi-process in a shell environment. It has been developed in the **System and Device Programming** course, during my Master of Science program.
  - `WebAppI-StudyPlan` contains a `Node.js` web application developed in the **Web Application I** course, during my Master of Science. The front-end of the application exploits the **React library** to build a single page application that connects to the back-end **Express framework** which provides services and data to the users.
