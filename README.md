## 🧑‍💻 About me
Hi! My name is **Davide Arcolini**, but you can call me `dvdr00t` 🤓!

As a Consultant at [**Liquid Reply**](https://www.reply.com/liquid-reply/en/) specializing in **LLM integration for application modernization**, I hold a Master of Science in **Computer Engineering** with a focus on cybersecurity from [**Politecnico di Torino**](https://www.polito.it/), Italy, earned in 2023, and a Bachelor's degree from the same institution obtained in 2021. During my academic journey, I delved into cybersecurity, engaging in projects such as developing a PRNG based on chaotic maps and participating in [**CyberChallenge.IT program**](https://bestr.it/award/show/rLlb917mQk-v6w0rGCpO8Q), ranking among the top 20 students. Additionally, I led teams in projects like [**Challenge@PoliTo**](https://bestr.it/award/show/8MiJNQU_R9uGIwqmioc4Uw) with [**Aruba S.p.A**](https://www.aruba.it/academy.aspx) and participated in various cyber-related conferences and competitions, including [**BIP CyberSec Talent Week**](https://www.vgen.it/it/bip-cybersec-talent-week/) and [**IEEE Eurocon 2023 B.Sc. and M.Sc. Student Competition**](https://2023.ieee-eurocon.org/). My master's thesis, "Full-Lifecycle API Management: Microgateway Infrastructural Pattern adopting Kong Gateway," was completed during my internship at Liquid Reply, where I focused on IAM solutions and automated API development on Kubernetes. I've also been active in [**IEEE-HKN's Mu Nu Chapter**](https://hknpolito.org/), serving as a Tutor and later as Head of Logistics and Fundraising, organizing events and dedicating over 230 hours as a teaching assistant at Politecnico, where I found fulfillment in simplifying complex concepts for others.
