## 👋 Hello there!

My name is Davide Arcolini 🤓. Happy to see you on my GitHub page! Hope you'll find here what you need and what you are looking for. Take a look around and *may the force be with you*.

## 🧑‍💻 About me
In 2021 I got a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering from **Politecnico di Torino** in Italy, with a 101/110 graduation mark. Currently, I am enrolled in the M.Sc. in Computer Engineering  at **Politecnico di Torino**, major in **CyberSecurity**.\
Moreover, I took part in the 2022 edition of **CyberChallenge.IT**, the italian training program for ethical hackers!

## 📚 About my GitHub Page
- On my profile you can find most of the courses I had attended during my studies. The repositories for these courses are named `PoliTo_<course_tag>`, such as: 
  - `PoliTo_OS` refers to the Operating System course;
  - `PoliTo_SDP` refers to the System and Device Programming course;
  - `PoliTo_CA` refers to the Computer Architectures course;
  - and so on.

  You can find what the tag refers to in the `README.md` file of every repository. Take a look at that also to know in which year I attended that particular course.

- Moreover, there are two *special* folders: 
  - `PNRGs` contains my essay (and code implementation) on **Pseudo-Random Number Generator based on Logistic Chaotic Map and Generalized Lorenz Systems**. 
  - `OS161-SHELL` contains the *os161* kernel implementation (ASST0 to ASST3). 
  
- Finally, there is the `CTFs Write-Up` folder, which contains a series of *write-ups* for some of the CTFs I attended (still working on it, my journey has just begun 😄). All the *write-ups* are very well commented assuming the reader knows nothing about the topics (since, more or less, that was my case).

> **As we are all learning (myself in the first place), feel free to suggest improvements of what you see!**

In the meanwhile, enjoy! 🧙🏼‍♂️
