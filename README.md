## üßë‚Äçüíª About me
Hi! My name is **Davide Arcolini**, but you can call me `dvdr00t` ü§ì!

I am a Master of Science student in **Computer Engineering**, enrolled in the cybersecurity track at [**Politecnico di Torino**](https://www.polito.it/) (TO), Italy. As an [**IEEE-HKN Mu Nu Chapter**](https://www.hknpolito.org/) inducted member and IEEE Young Professional, I am committed to embody the principles of the Eta Kappa Nu Honor Society: leadership, character, and attitude.

In 2021, I got a Bachelor‚Äôs degree at Politecnico di Torino, where I wrote a short thesis titled: ‚ÄúPRNG based on Logistic Chaotic Maps and Generalised Lorentz Systems‚Äù. I passioned about cybersecurity back in high school, working with an original Enigma Machine from 1943 and I then applied to the cybersecurity track at Politecnico di Torino. Here, I have actively engaged in various technical challenges. I ranked among the top 20 students from Politecnico di Torino in joining the [**CyberChallenge.IT program**](https://bestr.it/award/show/rLlb917mQk-v6w0rGCpO8Q), the Italian training program for ethical hackers organized by the [**Cybersecurity National Lab**]((https://cybersecnatlab.it/)). I've also attended cyber-related conferences like NoHat, m0lecon, and RomHack while managing my studies. As a team leader during the [**Challenge@PoliTo**](https://bestr.it/award/show/8MiJNQU_R9uGIwqmioc4Uw) with [**Aruba S.p.A**]((https://www.aruba.it/academy.aspx)), I helped develop password-less access methodologies for mobile and web applications. I've also taken part in the [**BIP CyberSec Talent Week**](https://www.vgen.it/it/bip-cybersec-talent-week/) and the [**IEEE Eurocon 2023 B.Sc. and M.Sc. Student Competition**](https://2023.ieee-eurocon.org/).

Today, I have completed my internship with [**Liquid Reply**](https://www.reply.com/liquid-reply/en/), where I am concurrently crafting my master‚Äôs thesis. During my time there, I focused on Identity and Access Management (IAM) solutions, studying the integration within Kong Gateway, Keycloak and OPA for hybrid and multi-cloud setups. I also automated API development on Kubernetes with CI/CD tools like Jenkins and GitHub Actions.

In 2022, I joined the Mu Nu Chapter at Politecnico di Torino, the [**Honor Society of the IEEE-HKN**](https://hkn.ieee.org/), where I started as a Tutor, organizing lectures on data structure courses. Later, I took on the role of Head of Logistics and Fundraising, which sharpened my organizational skills, as me and my colleagues arranged three events for the Politecnico community: a [**LaTeX Masterclass**](https://youtu.be/oAMvHd8ZcBs?si=Ox9W8C6umhFrdde9) (in which I also presented), a [**conference on quantum computing**](https://youtu.be/US-0U6EHW6o?si=YhDx50Y-LBSTngoU), and a series of talks on mental wellness and digital well-being. Over the last two years, I've spent more than 230 hours as a teaching assistant at Politecnico, helping fellow students with computer science and algorithmic courses. I find great satisfaction in simplifying complex ideas and aiding others in grasping them.

Happy to see you on my GitHub page! Hope you'll find here what you need and what you are looking for. Take a look around and *may the force be with you*.

## üìö About my GitHub Page
- You can discover the majority of the solutions and reports from the courses I participated in during my academic journey on my profile. The collection of materials for these courses is referred to as `Polilabs`. If you're a Politecnico student seeking exercise solutions, feel free to explore the repository.

- You can also find the `CTFs` folder, which contains a series of *write-ups* for some of the CTFs I attended (still working on it, my journey has just begun üòÑ). The original intention was to create a repository which contains write-ups in the form of small blog posts that covers more or less the whole topic of the challenge. However, this requires more time than expected, so feel free to help!

- Finally, there are some *special* folders: 
  - `PNRGs` contains my essay (and code implementation) on **Pseudo-Random Number Generator based on Logistic Chaotic Map and Generalized Lorenz Systems**. It a super cool project I did at the end of the Bachelor of Science program, working on chaotic systems to generate pseudo random numbers. Check it out!
  - `OS161-SHELL` contains the *os161* kernel implementation (ASST0 to ASST3) that allows the system to run concurrent multi-process in a shell environment. It has been developed in the **System and Device Programming** course, during my Master of Science program.
  - `WebAppI-StudyPlan` contains a `Node.js` web application developed in the **Web Application I** course, during my Master of Science. The front-end of the application exploits the **React library** to build a single page application that connects to the back-end **Express framework** which provides services and data to the users.
